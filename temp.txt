Spring security
- By default it works with authen enabled
- Can override classes and config behavior
- Must provide implem for UserDetails and PasswordEncoder
- If overriding AuthProvider, no need for user and pswd beans in the SecurityFilterChain
- Splitting config class, per responsability
    - example: auth (user + pswd) + authen (SecurityFilterChain )
